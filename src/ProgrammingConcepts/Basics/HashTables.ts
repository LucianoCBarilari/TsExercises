/*
Maps/Dictionaries (Hash Tables)
Description:
A map (or dictionary) stores key-value pairs. A hash table is an efficient implementation of a dictionary, where each key is hashed to quickly find the corresponding value.

Problem:
Create a dictionary where the keys are student names, and the values are their scores. Implement a function that takes a name as input and returns the corresponding score. If the name doesn't exist, return "Student not found."
