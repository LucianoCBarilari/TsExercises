/*
Linked Lists (Simple, Doubly, Circular)
Description:
A linked list is a collection of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node. In a doubly linked list, nodes also have a reference to the previous node. A circular linked list connects the last node back to the first node.

Problem:
Create a simple singly linked list where each node stores an integer. Implement functions to add a node at the beginning, at the end, and to delete a node.
