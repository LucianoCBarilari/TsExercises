/*
Queues (FIFO - First In, First Out), Deques, Priority Queues
Description:
A queue is a data structure that follows the FIFO principle, where elements are added at the end (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue). A deque (double-ended queue) allows inserting and removing from both ends. A priority queue returns the highest-priority element first.

Problem:
Create a basic queue with enqueue and dequeue operations. Then, extend it to implement a priority queue where each element has a priority, and elements are dequeued in order of their priority.
